<p>The papers has been full this transfer window, hearing 75 mill for Suarez, while Sanchez will he stay or will go to either Arsenal or Liverpool, but the one that has been 
for the wrong reason is Suarez for Liverpool fans. I like other fans is disappointed that the premiership could lose Suarez. 
He has had his trouble but he is truly a great player for the league and hope to see more young English Talents to get the chance.
 The fans should not be worried if he goes to Barcelona or Madrid, Bring on the new 2014/15 season.</p>
